# Materail Used

Something I have found very difficult to achieve perfectly is a plastic box to contain the printed circuit board.

I bought this temperature controller to use its casing as a box for my hardware.

I was looking for the solid state switch (SSR) that will control the oven resistance, but when I bought the temperature sensor, I saw this other temperature controller:

For $16 I got the SSR and thermocouple, the SSR is around $50 or more so I bought this to get the solid state relay on the cheap.

I opened the first temperature controller and this is what the internal PCBs look like (top and bottom, the one on the front for the display is smaller). I think my PCB(s) must have the same dimensions and must be designed with those contacts to fit into the terminal block on the back.

The LCD screen I'm going to use is called MOD-LCD3310

While I have decided to use the ATSAML21E18B microcontroller

To store information such as temperatures, times, constants and any other information, I will use an EERAM 47L16 memory
